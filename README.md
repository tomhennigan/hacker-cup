# Facebook Hacker Cup 2013

@tomhennigan's solutions to the Facebook Hacker Cup 2013. I played by the
rules and the solutions are entirely my own and what I submitted to FB.

## Qualification

## Round 1

Only managed to complete question 2 from this round. I wrote solutions for
question 1 and 3 but they weren't though through enough, and whilst they
functioned correctly on the example input, they weren't optimal enough to run
over the challenge input within the 6 minutes allowed.

With 6 hours left in the competition I'm currently ranked around #1500, however
my solution for question 2 hasn't been verified, it is just in the correct
format.
